      <h1>About Repaints Plus</h1>
      <h3>and how we deliver fresh repaints to you regularly</h3>
      <div id="bannerImage"><img src="images/SliderLayerImage.png" alt=""/></div>
      <p>It was in Early 2021, when Founder & CEO, Flynn Wright was inspired by his love of Flight Simulation, to create a company that revolved around it. Flynn Decided to Call it RepaintsPlus. This name encorporated all that Flynn wanted the company to be. Revolving around repaints for planes, but also incorporating other aspects of Flight Simulation, such as Sceneries, Sounds Packs, and most importantly Aircraft. Although Sound Packs and Aircraft haven't yet been announced, that doesn't mean that they are off the cards. As we grow our team of volunteers, we can increase or production of such products and keep Quality to a Maximum. </p>
      <p>One of the first staff members to join the team is Joshua Micallef. He has played an instrumental role in helping get the interfaces set up for the company. Joshua works alongside Flynn to ensure the daily operations of the company are run smoothly and have faults kept to a minimum. Repaints Plus has a Quality Standard, which is constatly upheld by our painters, that are committed to our 100% Job Done Garuntee before release. If a Livery or Scenery is not completed, we won't let it be released. This ensures that you have the best experience in the Simulator of your choice.</p> <p> Founder and CEO, Flynn Wright </p>
